# SoftwareRenderer
A 3D Software renderer written in C# .Net 7

![](readme/screenshot_001.png)

# Limitations
- Currently only the 3D format Wavefront object (obj) is supported
- Currently only textures in 24-bit bmp file format are supported. If your obj model uses textures in other formats, simply convert them to a 24-bit bmp file

# Notes:
- The .mtl file from the Wavefront object models are not used, you can delete them if you wish
